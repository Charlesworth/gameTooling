# Game Tooling

Python tooling monorepo supporting my crossplatform Unity dev. Tools work accross OSX, Windows and Linux as I do, tested with Python 3.9. The tools are pretty specific to [Alien Extraction](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1768730/Alien_Extraction/) development.

## Tools

- __backupUtil__: Used to zip a directory and transfer it to a remote server via rsync and to cloud storage via rclone.
- __scriptToSpeech__: Takes in script files and outputs speech MP3 files for robot voices in the game.
